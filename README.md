# Prompt Template Model Extension

**Pi prompt templates on steroids.** Adds `model`, `skill`, and `thinking` frontmatter support. Create specialized agent modes that switch to the right model, set thinking level, and inject the right skill, then auto-restore when done.

## Why?

Create switchable agent "modes" with a single slash command. Each mode bundles:

- **The right model** for the task complexity and cost tradeoff
- **The right skill** so the agent knows exactly how to approach it
- **Auto-restore** to your daily driver when done

Instead of manually switching models and hoping the agent picks up on the right skill, you define prompt templates that configure both. `/quick-debug` spins up a cheap fast agent with REPL skills. `/deep-analysis` brings in the heavy hitter with refactoring expertise. Then you're back to your normal setup.

## Installation

```bash
pi install npm:pi-prompt-template-model
```

Restart pi to load the extension.

## Quick Start

Add `model` and optionally `skill` to any prompt template:

```markdown
---
description: Debug Python in tmux REPL
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
skill: tmux
---
Start a Python REPL session and help me debug: $@
```

Run `/debug-python some issue` and the agent has:
- Sonnet as the active model
- Full tmux skill instructions already loaded
- Your task ready to go

## Skills as a Cheat Code

Normally, skills work like this: pi lists available skills in the system prompt, the agent sees your task, decides it needs a skill, and uses the read tool to load it. That's an extra round-trip, and the agent might not always pick the right one.

With the `skill` field, you're forcing it:

```markdown
---
description: Browser testing mode
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
skill: surf
---
$@
```

Here `skill: surf` loads `~/.pi/agent/skills/surf/SKILL.md` and injects its content directly into the system prompt before the agent even sees your task. No decision-making, no read tool, just immediate expertise. It's a forcing function for when you know exactly what workflow the agent needs.

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | Yes | - | Model ID, `provider/model-id`, or comma-separated list for fallback |
| `skill` | No | - | Skill name to inject into system prompt |
| `thinking` | No | - | Thinking level: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` |
| `description` | No | - | Shown in autocomplete |
| `restore` | No | `true` | Restore previous model and thinking level after response |

## Model Format

```yaml
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514            # Model ID only - auto-selects provider
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514  # Explicit provider/model
```

When you specify just the model ID, the extension picks a provider automatically based on where you have auth configured, preferring: `anthropic` → `github-copilot` → `openrouter`.

For explicit control:

```yaml
model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5        # Direct Anthropic API
model: github-copilot/claude-opus-4-5   # Via Copilot subscription
model: openrouter/claude-opus-4-5       # Via OpenRouter
model: openai/gpt-5.2                   # Direct OpenAI API
model: openai-codex/gpt-5.2             # Via Codex subscription (OAuth)
```

## Model Fallback

Specify multiple models as a comma-separated list. The extension tries each one in order and uses the first that resolves and has auth configured.

```yaml
model: claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

This tries Haiku first. If it can't be found or has no API key, falls back to Sonnet. Useful when you have multiple provider accounts with different availability, or want a cost-optimized primary with a guaranteed fallback.

You can mix bare model IDs and explicit provider/model specs:

```yaml
model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5, openrouter/claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

Here the extension tries Haiku on Anthropic first, then Haiku on OpenRouter, then Sonnet on whatever provider has auth. If you're already on one of the listed models when the command runs, it uses that without switching.

When all candidates fail, a single error notification lists everything that was tried.

## Inline Model Conditionals

Prompt bodies can embed model-specific instructions directly in the markdown:

```markdown
---
description: Cross-model code review
model: claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-20250514
---
Summarize the change first.

<if-model is="claude-haiku-4-5">
Keep the answer brief and cost-conscious.
<else>
Do a deeper pass and call out subtle risks.
</if-model>
```

Conditionals are evaluated against the model that actually runs the command after fallback resolution. That means the same template can render differently depending on which candidate was selected.

Supported matches inside `is="..."`:

- Exact `provider/model-id`
- Exact bare `model-id`
- Provider wildcard like `anthropic/*`
- Comma-separated lists combining any of the above

Examples:

```markdown
<if-model is="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514">...</if-model>
<if-model is="claude-sonnet-4-20250514">...</if-model>
<if-model is="anthropic/*">...</if-model>
<if-model is="openai/gpt-5.2, anthropic/*">...</if-model>
```

`<else>` is the fallback branch for the current `<if-model>` block. Nested blocks are supported.

Conditionals are a raw text preprocessing step, not markdown-aware syntax. If you want to show the directive literally inside a prompt, escape it in the source text, for example with `&lt;if-model is="anthropic/*"&gt;`.

## Argument Substitution

Prompt bodies support argument placeholders that expand to command arguments:

| Placeholder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `$1`, `$2`, ... | Positional argument (1-indexed) |
| `$@` | All arguments joined with spaces |
| `$ARGUMENTS` | Same as `$@` |
| `${@:N}` | All arguments from position N onward |
| `${@:N:L}` | L arguments starting from position N |

Example:

```markdown
---
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
---
Analyze $1 focusing on $2. Additional context: ${@:3}
```

Running `/analyze src/main.ts performance edge cases error handling` expands to:
- `$1` → `src/main.ts`
- `$2` → `performance`
- `${@:3}` → `edge cases error handling`

## Skill Resolution

The `skill` field matches the skill's directory name:

```yaml
skill: tmux
```

Resolves to (checked in order):
1. `<cwd>/.pi/skills/tmux/SKILL.md` (project)
2. `~/.pi/agent/skills/tmux/SKILL.md` (user)

This matches pi's precedence - project skills override user skills.

## Subdirectories

Organize prompts in subdirectories for namespacing:

```
~/.pi/agent/prompts/
├── quick.md                    → /quick (user)
├── debug-python.md             → /debug-python (user)
└── frontend/
    ├── component.md            → /component (user:frontend)
    └── hook.md                 → /hook (user:frontend)
```

The subdirectory shows in autocomplete as the source label. Command names are based on filename only. If duplicates exist within the same source layer, the first one found after lexical sorting wins and later duplicates are skipped with a warning. Reserved command names like `model`, `reload`, and `chain-prompts` are also skipped with a warning.

## Examples

**Cost optimization** - use Haiku for simple summarization:

```markdown
---
description: Save progress doc for handoff
model: claude-haiku-4-5
---
Create a progress document that captures everything needed for another 
engineer to continue this work. Save to ~/Documents/docs/...
```

**Skill injection** - guarantee the agent has REPL expertise:

```markdown
---
description: Python debugging session
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
skill: tmux
---
Start a Python REPL and help me debug: $@
```

**Browser automation** - pair surf skill with a capable model:

```markdown
---
description: Test user flow in browser
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
skill: surf
---
Test this user flow: $@
```

**Deep thinking** - max thinking for complex analysis:

```markdown
---
description: Deep code analysis with extended thinking
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
thinking: high
---
Analyze this code thoroughly, considering edge cases and potential issues: $@
```

**Model fallback** - prefer cheap, fall back to reliable:

```markdown
---
description: Save progress doc for handoff
model: claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-20250514
---
Create a progress document that captures everything needed for another 
engineer to continue this work. Save to ~/Documents/docs/...
```

**Cross-provider fallback** - same model, different providers:

```markdown
---
description: Quick analysis
model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5, openrouter/claude-haiku-4-5
---
$@
```

**Mode switching** - stay on the new model:

```markdown
---
description: Switch to Haiku for this session
model: claude-haiku-4-5
restore: false
---
Switched to Haiku. How can I help?
```

## Chaining Templates

The `/chain-prompts` command runs multiple templates sequentially. Each step switches to its own model, renders any inline model conditionals against that step’s resolved model, injects its own skill, and the conversation context carries forward between steps.

```
/chain-prompts analyze-code -> fix-plan -> summarize -- src/main.ts
```

This runs `analyze-code` first, then `fix-plan` (which sees the analysis in conversation context), then `summarize`. The `-- src/main.ts` provides shared args substituted into every template's `$@`.

Each step can also receive its own args, overriding the shared args for that step:

```
/chain-prompts analyze-code "look at error handling" -> fix-plan "focus on perf" -> summarize
```

Here `analyze-code` gets `$@ = "look at error handling"`, `fix-plan` gets `$@ = "focus on perf"`, and `summarize` has no per-step args so it falls back to the shared args (empty in this case, but conversation context from prior steps is usually enough).

You can mix both:

```
/chain-prompts analyze-code "error handling" -> fix-plan -> summarize -- src/main.ts
```

Step 1 uses its per-step args (`"error handling"`), steps 2 and 3 fall back to the shared args (`"src/main.ts"`).

The chain captures your current model and thinking level before starting, and restores them when the chain finishes (or if any step fails mid-chain). Individual template `restore` settings are ignored during chain execution.

## Autocomplete Display

Commands show model, thinking level, and skill in the description:

```
/debug-python    Debug Python session [sonnet +tmux] (user)
/deep-analysis   Deep code analysis [sonnet high] (user)
/save-progress   Save progress doc [haiku|sonnet] (user)
/component       Create React component [sonnet] (user:frontend)
/quick           Quick answer [haiku] (user)
```

## Print Mode (`pi -p`)

These commands work in print mode too:

```bash
pi -p "/debug-python my code crashes on line 42"
```

The model switches, skill injects, agent responds, and output prints to stdout. Useful for scripting or piping to other tools.

## Limitations

- Prompt files are reloaded on session start and whenever an extension-owned prompt command runs. If you add a brand-new prompt file while already inside a session, run another extension-owned command such as `/chain-prompts`, start a new session, or reload pi so the new slash command is registered.
- Model restore state is in-memory. Closing pi mid-response loses restore state.
- Only templates with a `model` field can be chained. Templates without `model` are handled by pi core and invisible to this extension.
